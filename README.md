At first glance, the user has the opportunity to review the complete table for its contents.  On the left side of the webpage, the user may choose to filter the data by date, city, state and country.  The web page allows the user to select 1 to 5 filters for their data analysis needs.

Filtering the data to California - there were 30 sightings. Then filtered to the city of El Cajon which had only 5.

If the user wanted to check for one particular sighting, the filtering code makes it easy!  As a user, I was at the location of a UFO sighting and I wanted to check to see if it was recorded, I fill in the required fields  -

That's the sighting!

## Summary
The webpage is easy to read, provides an information overview and a table that the user can interact with, thus making it interesting. Using the JavaScript into a HTML page and creating functions to create filters then filtereing the data and rebuilding a table on the user input is nice. The multi-level filtering function does a good job providing the information quickly.  

Limitations:

Filtering data has some limitations, such as ensuring one types the correct filter.  For example, typing "lights" versus the exact word "light" under shape returns no data.  This could lead to the user assuming no reporting of "lights".  

Recommendations:

A drop down box for each filter would let the user see what is available to choose for filtering. 
Another recommendation may be adding some calculation function instead of manually counting the sightings.
