## Overview
BellyButton study data was converted to an interactive dashboard by using JavaScript, Plotly and D3.js to create several charts and dropdown that allow the user to select specific samples.  In addition, the dashboard is linked to the web.

The gauge chart represents the washing frequency of belly button per week.  When the user selects a subject ID, the gauge chart changes to that sample.

Subject ID 947 selected, look at the number of washings per week- nice!

Finally, there is a "bubble chart" at the bottom that shows the number of samples and OTU IDs.
